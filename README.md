## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of **Linear Regression from scratch** using only Python and NumPy. It demonstrates how machine learning models work under the hood without using any high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

ðŸ§  **Goal**: Predict house prices based on area (in square feet).

### ðŸ”§ What it Covers:
- Building a linear regression model using only NumPy
- Mean normalization of input features
- Gradient descent algorithm from scratch
- Making predictions on new data
- Clear and beginner-friendly code, suitable for students

### ðŸš€ Sample Prediction:
```bash
Predicted price for 1000 sqft: 109.06 thousand $
Predicted price for 2000 sqft: 208.72 thousand $
